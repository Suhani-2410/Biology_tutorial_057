# ACO Pathfinding Demo Implementation

- [x] Add new section "ACO Pathfinding Demo" to index.html
- [x] Create pathfinding.js with ACO pathfinding simulation
- [x] Implement node selection (start/destination) by clicking
- [x] Add ACO algorithm with ants building paths probabilistically
- [x] Visualize pheromone trails and best path
- [x] Add "Run ACO" and "Reset" buttons
- [x] Ensure independent from existing simulation
