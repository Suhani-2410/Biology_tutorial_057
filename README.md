A biomimicry-inspired web project demonstrating how Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) can be applied to antivirus file scanning and shortest-path discovery. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with interactive visual simulations for educational purposes.

ACO-Based Antivirus with Website & Map Visualization
Goal:

To demonstrate how Ant Colony Optimization improves antivirus scanning using a website-based digital model with map visualization.

Step 1: Start System

User opens the project website in the browser.

Step 2: Display Introduction

Website shows:

Project title

Idea of Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)

How ant behavior inspires smart scanning

Step 3: Load Digital Model

When user selects “Simulation / Digital Model”, the system initializes:

Files and folders as nodes

Connections as paths

Virtual ants as scanning agents

Initial importance level (pheromone) for all files and paths

Step 4: Show Map Visualization

A network map appears where:

Nodes = files

Lines = scanning paths
This acts like a visual scanning map.

Step 5: Release Ants

Multiple virtual ants start moving from different files.

Step 6: File Selection

Each ant chooses the next file based on:

File importance level

File risk (unknown source, type, behavior)

Step 7: Scan Files

When an ant reaches a file:

System scans it for virus/suspicious activity

Suspicious file → marked red

Safe file → marked green

Step 8: Update Importance

After scanning:

Suspicious file & path → importance increases (brighter/thicker path)

Safe file & path → importance slightly decreases

Step 9: Continue Scanning

Ants keep moving and scanning more files.
Important (risky) routes become more visible on the map.

Step 10: Prioritize High-Risk Areas

Files and paths with highest importance are treated as priority threat zones.

Step 11: Show Final Output

Website displays:

List of detected threats

Highlighted high-risk files

Optimized scanning paths

Step 12: End

User understands how ACO helps:

Faster scanning

Smart prioritization

Better virus detection

✅ Final Outcome

This system combines:

Antivirus optimization algorithm

Website simulation

Map-based visualization

to clearly demonstrate intelligent, nature-inspired cybersecurity.
